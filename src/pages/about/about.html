      We believe that computing is affecting the lives of everyone on the planet 
      and we think is important to provide better tools for people 
      to access the potential offered by computer.

      This is why our goal is to provide better tools to people to perform their work. 
      We believe that languages are the most important tools because 
      we use them to think about our ideas, communicate and express them.
